# StakingAirdrop

This smart contract implements a staking-based airdrop system on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can stake ERC20 tokens to earn rewards and gain premium access based on the amount staked. The system encourages long-term staking by aligning user incentives with reward distribution over time. 
I also made a Solana based staking airdrop as well(https://github.com/btorressz/staking_airdrop)
